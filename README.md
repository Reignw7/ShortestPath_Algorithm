# Shortest Path Alogorithms (Dijkstra)

This Java program demonstrates the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. It includes classes for representing airports, networks (edges), and the graph itself.

## Features

- **Graph Class:** Manages the graph structure, including airports and connections.
- **Airport Class:** Represents an airport with a name and a list of connected networks.
- **Network Class:** Represents a network (edge) between two airports with a given cost.
- **Example Usage:** A main method in the Graph class showcases how to use the implemented classes and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Getting Started

1) Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (IDE).

2) Run the Graph class with the provided example to see the Dijkstra's algorithm in action.
