# Shortest Path Alogorithms (Dijkstra)

This Java program demonstrates the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. It includes classes for representing airports, networks (edges), and the graph itself.

## Features

- **Graph Class:** Manages the graph structure, including airports and connections.
- **Airport Class:** Represents an airport with a name and a list of connected networks.
- **Network Class:** Represents a network (edge) between two airports with a given cost.
- **Example Usage:** A main method in the Graph class showcases how to use the implemented classes and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Getting Started

1) Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (IDE).

2) Run the Graph class with the provided example to see the Dijkstra's algorithm in action.

# Bellman-Ford Algorithm in Java

This Java program demonstrates the implementation of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph. The algorithm works even in the presence of negative-weight edges.

## Features

- `BellmanFordGraph` Class: Implements the Bellman-Ford Algorithm to find the shortest paths.
- `House` Class: Represents a node in the graph.
- `Distance` Class: Represents a distance (edge) between two houses with a given weight.

## Example Usage

The main method in the `BellmanFordGraph` class showcases how to use the implemented classes and the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.

### Getting Started

1. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (IDE).
2. Run the `BellmanFordGraph` class to see the Bellman-Ford Algorithm in action.
